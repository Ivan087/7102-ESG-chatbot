Introduction
ESG stands for Environmental, Social, and Governance. It is a framework that helps stakeholders understand how an organization manages risks and opportunities related to sustainability issues. The framework has evolved over time, from historical movements focused on health and safety issues, pollution reduction, and corporate philanthropy to the emergence of socially responsible investing (SRI) in the 1970s and 1980s.
ESG emerged in the 1990s as a more comprehensive framework that incorporated environmental, social, and governance factors into investment decisions. Today, it has transformed how capital allocation decisions are made by some of the largest financial services firms and asset managers worldwide. An emerging class of ESG specialists supports both net-zero and carbon-neutrality goals.
Brief Overview of ESG

ESG is comprised of three key components. Firstly, the Environmental aspect refers to an organization's environmental impacts and risk management practices. This includes direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions, management of natural resources, and the firm's overall resiliency against physical climate risks such as climate change, flooding, and fires. Secondly, the Social pillar relates to an organization's relationships with stakeholders. Factors such as fair wages, employee engagement, and an organization's impact on the communities in which it operates are taken into consideration. It also extends to the company's supply chain partners, particularly those in developing economies where environmental and labor standards may be less robust. Lastly, Corporate Governance pertains to how an organization is led and managed. ESG analysts seek to better understand how leadership's incentives align with stakeholder expectations, how shareholder rights are viewed and honored, and what types of internal controls exist to promote transparency and accountability on the part of leadership.
The role of ESG in business and investment decisions has grown significantly in recent years. It has now become an integral part of many institutional investors' strategies, with growing numbers of ESG rating agencies assigning ESG scores and new reporting frameworks improving the transparency and consistency of the ESG information that firms report publicly.
Importance of ESG in Today's World
ESG plays a critical role in the modern corporate landscape. It has a profound impact on corporate reputation and brand value, as organizations recognized for strong ESG practices tend to enjoy better public perception and customer loyalty. Moreover, ESG contributes significantly to the achievement of sustainable development goals by promoting practices that reduce environmental impact, improve social conditions, and enhance corporate governance. However, the relationship between ESG and financial performance is a complex one, requiring a nuanced understanding that takes into account the specific context of each business.
